                " I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I have to say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an amazing developer. He stresses on good, clean code and pays heed to the details. I love developers who respect each and every aspect of a throughly thought out design and do their best to put it in code. He goes over and beyond and transforms ART into PIXELS - without a glitch, every time. "
